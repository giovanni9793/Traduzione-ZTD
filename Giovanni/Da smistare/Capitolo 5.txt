Questa porta non è chiusa, quindi possiamo andare<lf>nel salone quando vogliamo, ma...
Non pensare nemmeno di abbandonare Phi! Dobbiamo<lf> (stop) the process o aprire la porta dell'inceneritore!						(lunghezza)
Non è chiusa, ma non è il momento<lf>di andare!
Non è chiusa, ma andarcene non aiuterà...<lf>Il tempo rimasto è... Oh, per l'amor del cielo!
Questo è...oh, ci sono. Mostra come è classificata<lf>la spazzatura.
Potremmo mettere Phi sotto i– No, non è il<lf>momenti per gli scherzi!
...Sbrighiamoci e salviamola.
Questo manifesto mostra come è classificata<lf>la spazzatura.
Oh! Ci sono delle lettere svolazzanti al di sopra<lf>del manifesto!
...Huh? Dove?
Proprio qui. La "tic" in "plastic" is circled and<lf>in big letters.															(video)
Ah, devi essere in grado di vederlo grazie<lf>agli occhiali che indossi.
Credo tu lo chiami... realtà aumentata? Ma<lf>perché appaiono solo queste lettere?
I can see "tic" floating in the air while I have<lf>the goggles on.																(traduzione)
Se ha richiesto un così grande impegno vederlo,<lf>deve essere una qualche sorta si indizio.
Some letters are floating when I look through<lf>the goggles.
Right. Maybe it's some kind of hint...
Let's look at it again if we forget.
Some letters are floating on the poster when<lf>I use the goggles to look at it.
The letters I saw were the hint to open the<lf>shutter.
This is the poster categorizing trash, and...<lf>Augh, why am I even looking at this!
It's a poster about the categories for trash.
With the goggles on, I can see "tic" floating<lf>in the air here.
Hm. This appears to be some kind of<lf>augmented reality tech.
And it was the hint for opening the shutter.
I think there's something in the box hanging<lf>from the ceiling.
That's... I think it's a revolver. If it's real,<lf>maybe we can use it for something.
But we can't reach it from here.
Right. And even if we got to it, there's a<lf>padlock on it. Hmm, what should we do...
I think there's a revolver in the box, but we<lf>can't reach it and it has a padlock...
This was hanging from the ceiling. I could<lf>maybe use the gun if I can get it out...!
I wonder if there's something we can use<lf>inside this locker...
It's a toolbox!
Is this a mask...with goggles?
There isn't anything else here that we can<lf>use.
This looks like a dust chute.
If it is, do you think it's connected to the<lf>inside of the incinerator?
Possibly, but it looks like it's locked...
Oh, I think we can input some numbers here.
Hmm... Well, let's try something else.
Hey Sigma, over here! I can see some images<lf>in the air!
What are they?
Um... A screwdriver and two screws, I think.
Maybe it's some sort of clue. Let's take note<lf>of it.
I think we can put some numbers in here. Why<lf>don't we give it a try?
I can see a screwdriver and two screws.
And we can put some numbers in here. Let's<lf>try it again.
I saw a screwdriver and screws when I had<lf>the goggles on.
Maybe they have something to do with the<lf>number that goes here... Let's give it a try.
Let's try it again.
Oh... I guess that was right. I just put<lf>something in randomly...
The result is all that matters. We'll just take<lf>it as good luck.
I guess... And now we can send things to the<lf>other side! A step forward!
Oh, it's open! I knew these were the correct<lf>numbers!
Well done. Now we can send things to the<lf>other side.
U-Um... Guessing won't work, I suppose.
We don't have enough information yet. Let's<lf>look for a hint.
That wasn't it... It must have something to do<lf>with the screwdriver and screws I saw...
Then that means we don't have enough<lf>information. We can't get lucky every time.
You're right. Let's search around for more<lf>clues to open this.
Huh. I guess that was wrong... A three digit<lf>number...
If it's numbers, then does the "g" there stand<lf>for a unit of measurement?
Oh, so "g" is for grams then?
Wrong again. If "g" is grams, then we should<lf>be entering a weight here.
How about we input the weight of the objects<lf>you saw with the goggles on?
The weight... Do you think Phi would know<lf>something?
I think we can send items to the other side<lf>using this dust chute.
Phi! I'm dropping the gas torch into the dust<lf>chute! Please take it!
Got it...!
Let's get this toolbox to Phi.
Yeah. She should be able to open it since she<lf>has a screwdriver over there.
Phi! I'm sending the toolbox down the chute.<lf>Please take it!
Got it!
Oh, the goggles don't fit in the chute...
They look too big.
Hey Phi! Do you want this coin?
No!
Okay!
I don't think we need to send this coin to Phi.<lf>She told us she doesn't want it.
Oh! If I hold onto the chain and drop this down,<lf>I'll be able to pull it back up!
Phi, I'm dropping the box down! Could you<lf>open the lock for us?!
All right, I'm on it!
...But just how am I gonna open it. Let me just<lf>examine it first.
Whoa, hold on! I can't send this gun through!<lf>I need to see if I can use it on this side...
If I pull the chain up, I can get the gun!
I-I should...send Phi what...she needs...<lf>Anything... W-Was there anything else...
This is not the time for sending things over...!
Phi! I'm dropping something down the dust<lf>chute! Please take it!
Chute...? Sorry, I can't see my hand in front<lf>of my face in here. It's too dark!
Can you see about making it brighter in here<lf>first?
We can send things to Phi with this, but we<lf>better make it brighter in there first...
Should we send the toolbox to Phi?
Yeah. We don't have a screwdriver here, so<lf>let's see if she can get it open...
Phi! I'm dropping a toolbox down the chute!<lf>Please take it!
Got it!
This toolbox... I wonder if Phi could open it...
Phi! I'm dropping a toolbox down the chute!<lf>Please take it!
Got it!
...It's not opening. It looks like it's locked.
These goggles are showing me a screwdriver<lf>and some screws here.
Maybe that's the hint to opening it...?
Oh, well, we opened it already. I guess it<lf>doesn't matter now.
The goggles are too large to fit down the<lf>chute!
There are a bunch of meters here.
Is this a thermometer? It must measure the<lf>temperature inside the incinerator...
Is that a coin at the base of the needle...?<lf>Why would it be there?
This is probably a thermometer. There's a<lf>coin at the base of the needle.
Oh, the coin came off.
It's a thermometer. I don't think we can<lf>change it anymore.
A thermometer... This isn't going to help me!<lf>Oh! I need to hurry and do something!
...Huh. I think moving this slider changes the<lf>letter.
I wonder what it's for?
Maybe getting the correct combination will<lf>stop the incineration... Ah, not likely.
But it's still worth a shot to see if it does.
Hmm... Let's try this again?
I think the letters can be changed on this<lf>meter.
Yeah, it looks like we need to use the sliders.
Three letters... I feel like I just saw them<lf>somewhere.
Let's try this again.
Oooh, I've had enough! How about...this!
Oh, the shutter opened!
What? How'd you know the answer? It<lf>couldn't be a coincidence...
But it was... I just got lucky. I didn't expect it<lf>to open either...
I-I see... What are the chances, huh?
Okay, now it's brighter in here! I'll look for<lf>something... Uh, guys? You okay?
Er, this SHOULD be the right answer...
Good job. The shutter opened.
I did it!
Now that I can see in here, I'll try to look for<lf>something useful.
Hmm... Well, that was wrong...
I don't think we have all the information. We<lf>need to find a clue first...
Oh, that's wrong again...
Three letters... We better look around for<lf>more clues.
Huh, I guess that was wrong.
Three letters... You saw them before, right?
Yes, I saw them.... Um...
I got it wrong...again.
Hey, didn't you see something while wearing<lf>those goggles? Over at the poster...
Oh yes, it had three letters on it! Let's go<lf>look at it again.
We don't really need to mess with this again.
We already did this one... Next!
Phi is over on the other side of this shutter...
I don't think we can use our hands to open<lf>this... But Phi should see better once it is.
We can't open the shutter with our bare<lf>hands. We need to find a way to get it open...
We can see Phi from here. HEY! ARE YOU<lf>OKAY?!
Damn you, Zero. She looks so nervous locked<lf>in a place like that! I have to get her out!
Right! We have to either find her a way out or<lf>stop the incineration process!
Hey, uh, I can't really hear you guys, but could<lf>you get your butts moving and do something?!
Phi... We need to get her out of there.
Phi and Sigma can't move at all right now...<lf>I... It's all up to me!
Phi, are you all right?
You can see I'm just fine. The stench from the<lf>trash pile in the back is gagging me though.
Thank God... We need to get you out quick...<lf>Have you found anything helpful over there?
Nothing yet. It's too dark to look around. Can<lf>you see if you can make it brighter in here?
Okay, got it. We'll see what we can do.
Phi, did you find anything?
No... But I can do a more thorough search if<lf>you can get the lights on in here...
How are you doing over there, Phi?
All right. I'm looking around on this side.
Phi! Have you found something over there?!
No, I think that's everything on this side...<lf>Dammit, there's no time...!
What should I do... The time is...! Phi, did you<lf>find anything in there?!
Did you pull the box up? See if the gun can do<lf>anything!
O-Okay!
What should I... Phi! Have you... Did you find<lf>anything?!
Calm down, Diana. You have the gun there,<lf>right? See if it can do anything!
Gun... Okay, use the gun. Yes, okay, but on<lf>what...
What should I do with this gun...!
Diana! There's no time! Look around carefully,<lf>there must be something left!
...Is this a gas torch?
The door's locked, but there's no keyhole...<lf>Probably an electronic lock.
This door connects to the incinerator, right?<lf>If we can open it, then Phi can...
The door connects to the incinerator... It's<lf>locked.
Open... Please open! Hurry! Or they're going<lf>to...to...!
What's this...? Is that a button?
Hmm, looks like it. There are four screws<lf>holding the cover in place.
We can see a button here, but the cover over<lf>it is screwed on...
Oh, could we use this coin to unscrew it...?
Yes! They're off!
Seems like we didn't need a screwdriver<lf>after all.
There's a button under the cover, but we<lf>have to take the screws out first.
We don't have a screwdriver here... Could we<lf>use something else to take them off?
We removed the cover, but...should we really<lf>up and press this button so carelessly...
I'd like for a tiny guillotine to come out when<lf>you push it and chop off your hand...
Wh-What...?! I-I'm going to forget you said<lf>that thank you very much. I'm pushing it!
Oh good, my hand's still intact.
Something came out of the floor. What is it?<lf>It kind of looks like a chair from here.
Pushing the button again doesn't lower the<lf>chair.
Maybe this button releases the restraints...<lf>Of course it doesn't! Come ON!
Hm? The floor isn't level here. Like it could<lf>open up.
Maybe it's a trap?
...We better not stand on it if we can help it.
There's a section of the floor that isn't<lf>level. Does it mean something?
This is a chair...isn't it? We should try sitting<lf>on it.
Wha– Hey! Don't be hasty!
...Nothing's happening.
I-I see. It's harmless... Why is it here, then?
Do you want to try it out, too? It's a little<lf>hard though.
Eh, sure. Maybe we can figure something out<lf>by sitting on it...
Uh.
What?!
Wh-What the hell! I can't move!
Incineration in...three minutes.
What?! Hey Sigma! Diana! What the hell's<lf>going on!
I think we tripped something! I'm restrained,<lf>but Diana's fine!
What did you say?!
N-No... Why did it... It was fine when I sat on<lf>it, so why...?!
Take a deep breath, Diana. We can get past<lf>this if we just deal with it calmly.
Urg... O-Okay...hold on! I'll find a way to get<lf>the two of you out!
I'm counting on you. Phi first, she doesn't<lf>have much time left...!
Don't forget to look behind you! The box that<lf>hung from the ceiling dropped!
And now Sigma's trapped too... Oh, what<lf>should I do...
Stop focusing on me, Diana! I'm only being<lf>restrained. Phi! She doesn't have much time!
Y-You're right... I need to stop that!
Sigma...
I told you, don't worry about me! Phi doesn't<lf>have much time...!
Hey Diana, let me see the gun you got from<lf>the box.
Huh? This?
Hmm, you know what. The muzzle might fit the<lf>keyhole right next to me.
Ah... I think it just might! Okay, I'll try it!
Diana, just insert the gun into the keyhole<lf>with "STOP"! Hurry up!
D-Diana, have you lost your mind?! Why are<lf>you staring at me with those goggles?
I-I'm sorry! I don't even know what I'm doing<lf>right now...
Mrff, what-oof, are gaaah doing– STOP.<lf>What are you doing with my face?!
I-I'm sorry...! I just thought maybe there's<lf>something...
If you have the time to mess with people's<lf>faces, then go search somewhere else!
Oh...! Uh, wow, your chest is...strong.
...Satisfied?
Oh Sigma, what should I do...
Stay calm. First, you'll have to let go of my<lf>hand. It's okay, just look for some clues.
...What are you doing?
Um... I just thought, maybe an important clue<lf>would be hidden somewhere...
...Well, there IS something important there.
O-Oh my God, I'm sorry! It's not like that! I<lf>didn't mean... It's not like that!
It says "STOP" here, so maybe it'll stop the<lf>incineration process!
Hm, if it does then that's one less thing to<lf>worry about. Let's find the key that fits this.
We'd definitely feel calmer once Phi is safe.<lf>Wait a second... Isn't this keyhole too big?
It's a keyhole with "STOP" written above it.<lf>But doesn't the hole look too big for a key...?
Augh...! If only I had the key that goes with<lf>this, maybe I could stop the incineration...!
Oh...! Maybe that could fit into this keyhole...
I think the gun will go in here... Please fit...!
Can you hear me, Diana? How's it going<lf>there?
We're searching everywhere...
Dammit! There's nothing here! Diana! What<lf>about that side?!
Augh, what should I do...  There's no time!
I need to open the chained box first. Diana's<lf>waiting on the other side of the chute.
Diana and Sigma are over there... Damn! Why<lf>am I here...
But it's better that I'm the only one who got<lf>locked in.
Diana... Sigma... I'm counting on you guys.
I can see much better now that the shutter is<lf>out of the way.
...Even if I broke the glass on this I doubt I'd<lf>be able to fit through.
Dammit, Sigma said he can't move, but is he<lf>really okay? I should focus on myself first...
This is the hole for the dust chute...? It's<lf>impossible to send things from this side.
It's the hole for the dust chute...
Phi, can you hear me?
Yeah, what is it?
This is your time! Crawl over here through this<lf>hole! You got this!
You old bastard... That's impossible. I'd just<lf>get stuck because of my big chest.
Enough! Do you even know what big is... Gah.<lf>Diana, could you take off your clothes?
What? Me?! W-Wait, what are you two talking<lf>about?! We need to be serious about this!
...I don't think I'll fit through the hole.
Things would be better if I could get through<lf>this hole... Damn, I can't space out now!
There's nothing I can use in this pile of trash.<lf>...Man, it really stinks.
There's only trash here...and the stench is...
Maybe I could get out if I removed the iron<lf>bars... But they're bolted on tight.
...No use. These bars won't come off.
It's a thermometer. But why is one in here? To<lf>check the temperature of the trash?
I should keep in mind what temperature it's<lf>going to be when the incineration starts...
It's a thermometer. But why is it in the<lf>incinerator...?
Maybe I can heat this thermometer up...?
...The temperature is going up.
...
Hey Phi! You okay?!
Huh? Well, I'm not bacon yet... Did something<lf>happen?
The needle on the thermometer here is<lf>shooting up! Is it getting hot in there?!
No, I'm fine. I see, so it's connected to the<lf>thermometer outside.
I'm so glad... Huh? The coin here is...
A thermometer... I think Diana said something<lf>about one...
...Is this related?
A thermometer... Is the needle on the note<lf>the one on the thermometer over there?
Then maxing out the needle would mean...
If the thermometer on that side is connected<lf>to the one here, then when I heat it up...
...The temperature is going up.
I wonder how much heat I need to max the<lf>needle over there out.
...
Hey Phi! You okay?!
Huh? Well, I'm not bacon yet... Did something<lf>happen?
The needle on the thermometer here is<lf>shooting up! Is it getting hot in there?!
No, I'm fine. I see, so it IS connected to the<lf>thermometer outside.
I'm so glad... Huh? The coin here is...
This thermometer is probably just for solving<lf>the gimmick in the other room...
So this is the spot where the flames will come<lf>out from... I wonder how powerful this is.
Maybe there's something I can hide in or<lf>behind if the incineration starts up...
...Yeah, I didn't think so.
I know, maybe if I stuff the trash into the<lf>furnace... Dammit, it stinks to high heaven!
I need to stop firing myself up or else I really<lf>will be...
...Stay calm, Phi.
This looks like where the flames will come<lf>from... Am I going to burn up to ash...?
Hey, this is...!
There's something strange about this wall.<lf>As if something is attached to it...
Huh, something's screwed on here.
This section of the wall is screwed on.
This wall is screwed on. I doubt it's<lf>connected to the outside though.
...May as well take it off.
Is this some sort of clue? 188 pounds...?
...I'll hold on to the screws just in case.
Well, 188 pounds is about 85 kilograms. What<lf>is with this weight? ...Oh, maybe.
Sigma! How much do you weigh?
HUH? What's with this all the sudden... How<lf>much do YOU weigh?
Call HR, this is sexual harassment, old man.<lf>Just answer. Is it 188 pounds?
Yeah, more or less... How'd you know?
Is it a coincidence it says that? No, it can't<lf>be. It must be part of Zero's plan...
This is just about how much Sigma weighs...
The 188 pounds. Sigma's weight. Damn, I<lf>knew it wasn't a coincidence. We screwed up!
Only this section of the wall is weird, and it<lf>has screws... That's screaming "Look at me!"
I think I can take it off...
This part of the wall has screws... I think I<lf>can remove it with the screwdriver.
This looks like a weight station... Why is one<lf>of these inside an incinerator...
Oh! I must have to weigh something!
I don't particularly want to weigh myself.
I should try weighing something here.
It's a weight station. I'll try weighing this<lf>screwdriver.
133 grams...
This screwdriver weighs 133 grams.
A weight station. I'm going to weigh these<lf>screws.
Okay, 22 grams. So each one is 11 grams.
Two screws weigh 22 grams.
Now to see how much this gas torch weighs...
360 grams...
This gas torch weighs 360 grams.
A toolbox. There better be some tools inside<lf>that I can use...
Hm... It's not opening. It's screwed shut.
It's screwed shut. Heh... Imagine that, a<lf>toolbox that needs a tool to open.
Okay, what's inside... Huh? It's some kind of<lf>puzzle in here.
Doesn't look like the tools are set<lf>correctly... It's just like a puzzle.
I'll try again.
Good. They're all in place now.
Oh, the bottom compartment opened.
It says "Max out the needle!" Needle... Hmm...
Diana! Is there a needle over there?
A needle? No, I don't think so... Oh, but<lf>there's a needle over on the meter.
Which meter?
Um, I think it's for a thermometer?
I see...
...They're not fitting right.
They won't fit...
I should find the tool that fits in the top left<lf>corner to start.
Everything fits. I don't have to deal with this<lf>anymore.
Okay, all of them are set correctly.
Oh, the bottom compartment opened.
It says "Max out the needle!" Needle... Hmm...
Diana! Is there a needle over there?
A needle? No, I don't think so... Oh, but<lf>there's a needle over on the meter.
Which meter?
Um, I think it's for a thermometer? But the<lf>needle's already maxed out and not moving.
Ah, then I've already heated it up... Damn,<lf>this note's no help.
A toolbox. I hope there are tools in there that<lf>I can use...
Huh? The cover is screwed on tight.
The cover's screwed shut and won't open...<lf>Dammit, I don't have time for this...
Okay, the inside... This...is a puzzle? At a<lf>time like this?!
The tools aren't in correctly. Does that mean<lf>I have to fix them? I need to hurry.
There's no time... But I'll try again.
...Damn! They aren't fitting right.
I can't do this... No, calm down...
I have to start with the tool that fits into the<lf>top left corner first.
There's nothing useful here.
A padlock... I can't open it without a key. Oh?
The keyhole is shaped like a hexagon... Hm.
A padlock... The hole is in the shape of a<lf>hexagon. Will anything fit here...
If I use the grip like so...
Yes! It's open!
Diana, I opened the lock! Pull the chain up!
Got it!
This isn't the time to examine it. Oh man, my<lf>nerves are about to snap.
I need to find a way to open that box...!
There's no time. I must open that box...!
This must be the exit... Nope, locked.
I don't see a keyhole, so it has to be<lf>electronically locked.
That's the exit, but it's locked.
Open up! OPEN! ...Damn! It's not budging.<lf>I'm not going to be burned to death in here!
This looks like a control console. But<lf>nothing's happening when we touch it.
Open... Please open! Why is this... What<lf>should I do?!
Fluorescent lights. They're pretty normal.
There must be a way... A way to...! Please...<lf>No, I can't give up...!
This is... Oh, I see. When it opens, the ashes<lf>go down here.
...Here's hoping that doesn't end up being<lf>me.
This is for disposing of the incinerated<lf>trash... I need to get out of here soon.
It's a small gas torch.
This makes me want to sear some meat or<lf>fish...
If we make it out safely, I definitely want to<lf>eat something nice.
It's a small gas torch. We need to handle it<lf>carefully.
A small gas torch.
Fight fire with fire, they say... As if. Like this<lf>tiny torch will outburn an incinerator.
It's a small gas torch. I can burn or heat<lf>something up with it...
A small gas torch. I put it on the weight<lf>station and it weighs 360 grams.
It's a toolbox. We can't open it because it's<lf>screwed shut.
And the tool to open it is INSIDE the box...<lf>Damn you, Zero.
It's a toolbox. We can't open it because it's<lf>screwed shut.
It's a toolbox. It's screwed shut.
Could we open it with the coin we have?
Oh, let's try it!
...Hmm, looks like the coin is too thick. We<lf>need an actual screwdriver for it.
This looks like a gas mask... Why would<lf>something like this be here?
Why not try it on? You might look good.
If you think complimenting everything a<lf>woman wears is okay, you're very wrong, sir.
It's a goggle mask... What can we use this<lf>for?
I can see things floating in the air when I put<lf>this on!
It probably has some kind of AR function...<lf>Augmented Reality.
Nothing special about a flathead<lf>screwdriver. The grip is hexagonal.
It's just a tool for taking screws off.
A flathead screwdriver with a hexagonal<lf>grip.
A flathead screwdriver with a hexagonal<lf>grip. It weighs 133 grams.
Two screws I removed from the wall... Maybe<lf>I can use them for something?
Two screws I removed from the wall...
Two screws I removed from the wall. Their<lf>total weight is 22 grams.
This just looks like a regular coin.
I doubt there's anything to it. But I bet we can<lf>use it for something.
It's a regular coin. Maybe we can use it for<lf>something?
The chained box that was hanging from the<lf>ceiling... I need to get the lock open.
I think the keyhole is hexagonal... Oh, the<lf>time is...!
How can I open this chained box...! The hole<lf>for the key is hexagonal...
A revolver... It's heavy, so it must be real.<lf>Maybe I can shoot Sigma's restraints...
No, I don't think that would work... There's no<lf>time and I can't think straight! What do I do?!
A revolver... I can't just go around firing it,<lf>so what should I do with it?!
A revolver... What should I do... Huh?
The muzzle... Maybe it'll fit...
Maybe the muzzle of this gun will fit in the<lf>keyhole...!
